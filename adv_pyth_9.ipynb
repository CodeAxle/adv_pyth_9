    "# String Methods:\n",

    "# on strings, including:\n",
    "    \n",
    "# a) String modification (limited): While strings are immutable, some methods create a new string object with the modification.\n",
    "#     Examples include upper(), lower(), strip(), etc.\n",
    "# b) Searching: Methods like find(), index(), and rfind() help you locate substrings within a string.\n",
    "# c) Splitting and joining: You can split strings into lists using split() and join elements of a list into a string using join().\n",
    "# d) Formatting: String formatting with the format() method or f-strings (f literals) allows you to create dynamic strings\n",
    "#     with variables.\n",
    "# e) Regular expressions: The re module provides powerful tools for advanced pattern matching and string manipulation using \n",
    "#     regular expressions\n",
    "    \n",
    "# some important methods:\n",
    "# 1. capitalize(): Converts the first character of the string to uppercase and the rest to lowercase.\n",
    "# 2. casefold(): Returns a casefolded copy of the string (similar to lowercase but more aggressive).\n",
    "# 3. center(width, fillchar): Returns a centered string of length width with the original string centered and padded \n",
    "#     with fillchar if necessary.\n",
    "# 4. count(sub[, start[, end]]): Returns the number of non-overlapping occurrences of substring sub in the string.\n",
    "# 5. endswith(suffix[, start[, end]]): Returns True if the string ends with the specified suffix, otherwise False.\n",
    "# 6. find(sub[, start[, end]]): Returns the lowest index of substring sub in the string, or -1 if not found."

    "\n",
    "# a) Default Unicode Behavior:\n",

    "# 1. In Python 3.x, explicit encoding and decoding are necessary when working with bytes and strings. This ensures clarity and\n",
    "#     helps prevent encoding-related bugs.\n",
    "# 2. Python 2.x had implicit conversion between byte strings and Unicode strings, which could lead to encoding errors if not\n",

    "# c) Print Statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. In Python 3.x, the print statement was replaced by the print() function, which requires parentheses. This change facilitates \n",
    "#     consistency with other function calls.\n",
    "# 2.Python 2.x used the print statement without parentheses, which could lead to confusion and inconsistencies in code style.\n",
    "\n",
    "# d) str vs bytes Distinction:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Python 3.x distinguishes clearly between text (Unicode) strings (str type) and byte strings (bytes type). This distinction \n",
    "#     helps in writing code that handles text and binary data appropriately.\n",
    "# 2. Python 2.x had a single str type that could represent both text and binary data, leading to potential confusion and bugs.\n",

    "# 1. Python 3.x introduced new string formatting methods like f-strings (f\"Hello {name}\") and the str.format() method, \n",
